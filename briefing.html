<h2><a name="plan"></a></h2>
<p>There are 2 groups of gangsters struggling for the control of all illegal activities, such as drugdealing, car stealing, prostitution, blackmailing, gambling...<br>
The first is called "The Familia". The Members are snotnosed and just think the law applies to someone else.<br>
The second is "The Gang", a group of bikers, that like to drive choppers and cause trouble.<br>
The third playable fraction is the Police of Nogova. Needless to say what they have to do...<br><br>

See the <A HREF="#Features">Features and how to play !!!</A><br><br>

<b><u>Don't kill and don't die!</u></b><br>
It makes no sense...<br>
- to kill civilians, because you can rob them (gangsters) or you get penalty (police)<br>
- to get killed, because you will loose all your cash, weed  and weapons (gangsters)<br>
- to throw your money away, because the team with the most money on the bank will win

<u><b>How to make money as a gangster:</b></u><br><br>

-	Rob civilians<br>
-	Build weed farms, harvest and sell your drugs<br>
- 	Rob ambulances, synthesize the meidcs to Angel Dust (at bar or HQ), Sell it to Junkies<br>
-	Steal cars and sell them (if you do not want them for yourself)<br>
-	Collect protection money from shops<br>
-	Build a bar or a casino where the cash flows<br>
-	Build a brothel and collect women to work there<br>
-	Do gun running missions for the gunstores<br>
-	Rob a Bank<br>


<u><b>How do cops make money:</b></u><br><br>

-	The income depends on the number of gangsters in play<br>
-	Freeing Women from the brothels<br>
-	Protect shops from the Gangsters<br>
-	Burn weed farms <br>
-	Do a razzia at gangster bars or casinos <br>
-	Secure stolen cars... bring them to the police station-flag<br>
-	Arresting gangsters gives you an award that depends on the “crimerate” of the gangster<br><br><br>


<u><b>Other possible actions:</b></u><br><br>

-	Gangsters can make women follow. Be creative in using this (not only for collecting your hookers)<br>
-	Gangsters can recruit gunmen…<br>
-	Buy a fuel canister… to... refuel a car :P… you can put it on the ground and shoot at it as well. Cops can use them to burn down the weed plantations (gangsters can do this too, but it´s not recommended ;) )<br>
-	Buy a repairkit… to -erm... guess what...<br>
-	Buy better weapons at the gunshops<br>
-	Buy cars… if necessary… at your HQ, bar or at the cardealer<br>
-	Feign death or surrender (hands up)… the AI will not shoot at you, if you do this<br>
-	Hide handguns… if you don´t have another weapon the ai won´t shoot at you<br>
-	Call a taxi<br>
-	Gangsters can remove police barriers<br><br>
<br>

<u><b>Other Features:</b></u><br><br>

-	The duration of the arrest depends on the crimerate of the gangster (CR in sec)<br>
-	Copkillers are marked on the map and it is the highest scored crime you can commit<br>
-	If a player dies he looses all his cash, money and additional weapons (you always start with a handgun)… so it might be better to be arrested<br>
-	Teams' vehicles respawn at HQs and bases<br>
-	Gangsters can not enter police stations<br>
-	Showscore-option<br>
-	player and team statistics<br>

<br><br>



<u><b>Cops only:</b></u><br><br>

-	Cops can jump from one police station to another at their radio buildings<br>
-	Cops have bigger choice of vehicles and weapons… (depending on “global crimerate”)<br>
-	Cops don't need cash, they pay with “police-account-card” ;)<br>
-	Cops can… well,... arrest and disarm Gangsters<br>
-	Cops can build barriers at police cars<br>
-	Talk-Menu: they can say short orders, that other players can hear, if they are near. (will be improved)<br>
